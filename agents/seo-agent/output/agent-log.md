✅ **Completed**

- Created new blog post: **"Septic Backup After Heavy Rain: Why It Happens & What to Do"**
  - Slug: `septic-backup-after-heavy-rain`
  - Category: Troubleshooting
  - ~1,700 words of substantive, original content
  - Targets the unaddressed query cluster: *"septic backup after rain"*, *"septic system problems after heavy rain"*, *"why does rain cause septic problems"*

- **Why this keyword:** None of the 38 existing posts address rain-triggered septic failures — a high-urgency, high-volume search with strong emergency intent (people actively experiencing the problem)

- **Content covers:**
  - 3 mechanisms causing failure (soil saturation, groundwater rise, surface runoff infiltration)
  - 6 warning signs to watch for after storms
  - 30-minute action checklist (with a warning callout about not pumping during flooding)
  - Recovery timelines by rain severity
  - 6 prevention steps
  - Clear escalation guidance for when to call emergency service

- Updated `emergency-services` related posts in `lib/services.ts` to surface this post on the emergency service page

- TypeScript type-check: clean ✅
- Committed as Run #23
